## About

This repository provides the foundations of a basic 2D platformer project for Unity 3D and is intended for use as a game jam starter kit.

While this starter kit is (alomst) plug-and-play, it is *not* a complete solution; there are many things left to you.

## Getting Started

* Clone this repo
* Open Unity Hub and add the folder for your clone
* Open the project
* Window -> TextMeshPro -> Import TMP Essential Resources
* In the Project explorer, right-click "psema4" and Reimport
* Press the Play button in the Unity editor

## Creating a Game

### Background

This starter kit was inspired primarily by [2D Platformer in Unity series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfX6C2dxVyLw5kerGvTxB-8xqVINe85gw) from Muddy Wolf Games and Zyger's [How to make a Level Editor in Unity](https://youtu.be/eWBDuEWUOwc).  Serialization of sprite data, generated with the runtime level editor, is derived from [Loading a JSON Collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-r4l-OcZtw) by First Gear Games.

After reading the Conventions below, and watching the videos above, you should understand

* how to add new Sprites
* how to add new Level Editor items to drop into levels
* how level data is serialized
